        <p>1. <b>Welcome! Shakespeare's World invites you to transcribe early modern manuscripts in order to help researchers and improve the Oxford English Dictionary. Only transcribe what you can read confidently: you can do as little as one line on a page or a whole page one line at a time. </b>Click ‘Transcribe Text’ (left) and then click at the start and end of a line. Blue dots appear, and the second dot triggers a transcription box and keypad. Grey dots surround lines that are fully transcribed already. Skip these. <b>Preserve spelling, punctuation and capitalisation: you might discover new words or unrecorded spellings which will be added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Modernisation won’t help!</b> Click ‘save changes’ after each transcription.</p>

        <p>2. Use the keypad for common abbreviations such as w<sup>ch</sup> meaning w<i>hi</i>ch, or y<sup>t</sup> meaning th<i>a</i>t. Always use abbreviation buttons when you can in order to create consistent data. Sometimes you may need to add letters. In this example, click the ‘Ma<sup>tie</sup>’ abbreviation and add an ‘s’ to make ‘Maiesties’.

        <p>6. <b>Deletions, insertions, unclear text, and superscript</b>: If text is deleted but legible, write out the word(s), highlight them with your cursor and click ‘deletion’ on the keyboard under the transcription box. If a word is inserted over a line, write it out, highlight and click ‘insertion’. Use the ‘unclear’ button to record genuinely obscured or damaged text.
