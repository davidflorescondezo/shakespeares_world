<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>Why Transcribe?</h2>

<p>Paleography involves the study and interpretation of historical handwriting. The word derives from the Greek words <i>palaiós</i> (old) and <i>graphein</i> (to write). It is an important skill for scholars studying early modern period (late 15th-early 18th centuries).</p>

<p>Many of the English manuscript documents in the Folger Shakespeare Library from the early modern period are written in a script known as “secretary hand.” Majuscule (upper case) and minuscule (lower case) letters were written differently than in modern cursive hand. With a little training and some practice, you can learn how to transcribe, or write down, the words in these digitized manuscripts. </p>

<p>When documents are transcribed, they can be easily searched for names of people and places. Transcriptions make these texts more accessible to scholars and educators.</p>

<h2>Semi-Diplomatic Transcription</h2>

<p>For Shakespeare’s World, you will be doing a “semi-diplomatic transcription.” This means replicating the original spelling, punctuation, and capitalization of the manuscript. Resist the temptation to modernize spellings of words or to add modern punctuation! </p>

<p>You will also identify or describe any graphics (marks or drawings) in the document and transcribe marginalia (labels, text, or headings appearing in the margins of the page that are not part of the main body of the document).

<h2>Five Points to Remember About Early Modern Paleography</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Paleography is NOT an exact science, but the more you do over time, the better you’ll be! Start by scanning a page for letters or words you feel you can transcribe, and remember, you can do as little as one word at a time!</li>
    <li>Spelling was not fixed in the early modern period, so forgot what modern letters look like, and forget modern spelling and punctuation. Minuscules (lower case letters) and majuscules (upper case letters) are often used inconsistently. </li>
    <li>Every individual scribe has an individual, inconsistent hand and approach to spelling and punctuation. Just transcribe exactly what you see. </li>
    <li>These documents were composed on rough paper or vellum with quill pens. In trying to figure out  a letter or word, it helps to think of how the letters are formed. Lighter, thinner strokes are usually upstrokes and thicker strokes are usually downstrokes. </li>
    <li>Be aware of interference from letters in the lines above and/or below the line on which you are working. </li>
